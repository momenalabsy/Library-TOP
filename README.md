# Library-TOP

# Overview

This simple web application allows users to input information about a book, including its title, author, and the number of pages. Upon submission, this information is used to create a new book object, which is then added to the library. The library is dynamically updated to display the added books.

# Usage

1.Enter Book Information:

Provide the title, author, and number of pages for the book in the respective input fields.

2.Add Book:

Click the "Add" button to submit the information. This action creates a new book object, adding it to both the dynamically updated library and the Book Library data structure.

3.Remove Book:

Each book in the library is accompanied by a "Remove" button. Clicking this button removes the book from both the DOM and the Book Library data structure.

# How It Works

The application utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive interface for managing a virtual book library.

Each book is represented as an object with properties such as title, author, and pages.

The "Remove" button triggers the removal of a book from both the display and the underlying library data.
